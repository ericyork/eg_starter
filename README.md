# eg_starter
This is a basic project scaffold: i.e. a structure for setting up a simple static site, so you can start with the same few things in place each time.

## Including
It includes modern-normalize.css, a style.css with some test styles, a page.js file with some test scripts, and an index.html file that displays the tested styles and script to verify the links are working.

## How to Use
To use this starter, simply download a copy, change the name of the folder and delete the contents of the style and page files, and delete the p tags in the index file.
